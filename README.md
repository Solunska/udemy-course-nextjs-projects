# Node.js Course Projects

Welcome to the Node.js course projects! In this repo, you'll find a single project that builds up different sections of the course. Iâ€™ve divided it into separate folders to keep things organized for better learning progress. Each folder focuses on a core concept of Node.js, providing hands-on exercises and practical examples along the way.
